Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of designing and creating high-quality softwares within a given time limit and budget.
importance of software engineering.
1. High quality softwares
2. Economic growth and digital transformation
3. innovation and trending echnologies
4. Enhancing efficiency and productivity
5. cost reduction and resource optimization
6. scalability and maintainability


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The birth of software engineering: The term "Software engineering" was first mentioned at Nato conference meeting.
2. The rise of structured programming language: before structured programming, softwares were created in unstructured and chaotic matter which made it difficult to debug and maintain code
3. The agile manifesto and agile development. The traditional development methodologies were slow, rigid and unable to adapt to changing requirements.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning: This is the initial process before actualization of the development itself. You must have the idea and plan for the solution.
2. Requirements analysis: After actualizing the idea the next step is to gather the requirements so as to go to the next phase which is designing.
3. Design: How do you want your software to look like and how to make it appealing to the eyes of your potential clients.
4. Implementation: After having the prototype i.e the design, now make your hands dirty by starting to code the software as represented in the design template.
5. Testing: After finalizing the implementation phase the next phase is to test if the code is running without bugs and fix any if they occur.
6. Deployment. If the code is actually running as per the requirements and prototype, now it is time to deploy the code and be accessible from the cloud.
7. Maintenance and support: The final phase is to provide mainteinance and support if it faces bugs in the deployment environment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is sequential and linear while Agile is iterative and incremental
in waterfall methodology changes in requirements are difficult to implement while in the case of Agile development it is highly adept to changes in requirements
in waterfall high risks, issues are discovered late while incase of Agile lower risks and early identification of risks
waterfall methodology the software is delivered as the complete package at the end while in Agile the software is delivered in small increments referred as springs.



Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer is responsible for designing, coding and maintaining software applications.
Quality Assurance on the other hand is responsible for ensuring the quality of software by testing, identifying bugs and verifying that the software meet the requirements.
Project Manager is responsible for overseeing the entire software development lifecycle, ensuring the project meets deadlines, budget and goals.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs and VCS plays a crucial role in software development by improving efficiency, collaboration and code management during the entire process.
IDEs provides a platform where you can write your code and test if it is running as intended.
VCS tracks and manages changes to sources code allowing developers to collaborate and revert to previous changes.



What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Debugging a complex code: To solve this challenges you can opt to use developer tools like chrome devtool, dbg and pycharm debugger.
2. Managing project deadlines: use agile development methodology by dividing the work into sprints, also you can use project managemt tools like, trello and jira
3. security vulnerabilities: vulnerabilities are flaws within a system which can be exploited, ensure ou validate user inputs, encryption and provide least priviledge
4. Handling system scalability: failure to handle increasing users and data, to solve this you should implement load balancing and implement caching

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. unit testing: It is a software testing method that involves individual testing or function in isolation to make sure it is running properly.
   it is important because it enables the developer to catch the bug early without time wasting.
   Also it makes debugging easier.
2. Intergration: It involves testing how modules, components or services interacts with one another. It ensures seamless communication with one another.
   It is important because it enables detection of data flow and Api interaction.
   Also it enables components to work together
3. System Testing: This involves testing the entire application in real world environment.
   It validates if all the features functions well in real environment.
   It ensure the software business and user needs
4. Acceptance Testing: It is a testing type that is used to determine if the software is ready for release.
  It confirms that the software is ready for production.
  It reduces the risk of deployment failures
  It ensures customers satification and compliance with requirements,

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and optimizing input prompts to achieve desired responses from AI models, such as ChatGPT

importance of Prompt engineering.
1. Improves AI response quality
2. Enhance High quality Response
3. increase efficiency
4. customizes AI for specific use
5. Facilitates better decision-making


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt.
"Tell me about cybersecurity"

Improve version.
"Expalin the top five cybersecurity threats in 2025 and recommend mitigation steps for each threat."

The improved prompt is more effective because;
1. It more specific. It is only targeting on the cybersecurity threats and mitigations
2. clearly defined scope. It limits the discussion to five threats
3. Time context. It is focusing on the current threats because of 2025
4. Action-oriented. explicitly asking for mitigations for the stated threats.
